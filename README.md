## Description

Welcome to my portfolio, built using React. This app is a showcase of all the work I have created so far during my time at the University of Birmingham Coding Boot Camp.

Some of the technologies that I used to create this app are:

- React
- React Storybook
- Formspree
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

As part of the project, I had to ensure that the following criteria were met:

- My portfolio needed to have a header, navbar, footer and a project section
- I should have a contact page, which contained a contact form with validation.
- My projects section should contain at least 6 of my projects with pictures and links to both the github repo and the deployed application.
- There should be other ways to contact me including links to my social media platforms like LinkedIn
- There should be a way to download/view my resume.

## Installation
