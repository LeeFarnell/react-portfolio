          Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Lee Farnell and I am currently a
          student with the University of Birminghamâ€™s Coding Boot Camp.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the course draws to a close, I am looking to become a fullstack
          developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please have a look around and check out some of the projects I have
          worked on and the experience I have gained.
